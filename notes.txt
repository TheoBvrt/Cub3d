main struct:

mlx struct:
img pointer (pointer to what the screen shows)
win pointer

map struct:
int **map
player pos: point
map width int
map height int


Player struct:
angle (direction): double (Radians)
position: int: x and y (in pixels not in the grid)
FOV: in radian
left or right: int
up or down: int
rotation: int

ray:
angle: double (angles are always represented in radian (double))
distance to wall: double
flag to know when wall hit: int (bol)




Taking a step
verifiying only the wall position

Drawing:
start at dir - FOV / 2
check for a wall in x and y
render wall depending on which is hit first
